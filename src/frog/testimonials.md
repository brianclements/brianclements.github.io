>"The quote 'Those who can't ~ teach', couldn't be further from the truth when speaking about Brian Clements. Not only is he a gifted performer, but he's a teacher who inspires young musicians to play with skill, heart and truth. And as my son says, 'He makes playing music 'COOL!'"

>"We have known Brian for over a year now. My son learns flute from him. Brian is not just knowledgeable in music and technique but also in working with kids. He knows how to make learning a positive experience for children. He is able to walk the fine line between being fun while being serious, connecting with students at their level, while setting the bar high and inspiring them to do better. He is a sincere teacher, who is passionate about teaching. His students mean a lot to him, and he shows it! We were touched when he kept my sonâ€™s spot open for an extended period of absence, because my son was forced to take a break.

>When my son began, he was not very sure about which wood wind instrument he wanted to play. But almost right way, he set his eyes on the flute. Brian played a key role in encouraging my son to pursue this tough first time woodwind instrument. My son has evolved into a becoming a confident and very enthusiastic student of flute. More importantly, he enjoys the instrument, and is not afraid to try his own tunes or even play it just to relax himself. I thank Brian for this."
