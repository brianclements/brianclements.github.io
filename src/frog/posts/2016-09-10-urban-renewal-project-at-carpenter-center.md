I'm very excited to be joining the [Urban Renewal Project] next month at the
[Carpenter Center] down in Long Beach. We will be providing a short tour of the
world of big band repertoire from it's inception to the role it has played in
modern day hip-hop from production to sampling. It's sure to be a great show!
