New music debut & album pre-release event:

Come hear the band's new music, described respectively by [HipHopDX.com] and
[BuzzBands.LA] as "funky, uplifting" and "cool as the other side of the pillow."

We'll be playing all the way through our forthcoming album—10 tunes that will
include some appearances by special guests. This is our first new music in 2
years, so not a performance to be missed. Best of all it's free!

As we tend to do, we will be playing at one of the best spots in Downtown LA:
[The Edison]. Head over to their site for reservations and more details.

Thursday, December 15th

Doors at 5pm

DJ at 7pm

Concert 8-11:30pm
