The [Urban Renewal Project] is back at [The Federal Underground] in Long Beach
next Thursday, July 13th. We'll be sharing the stage with some really incredible
bands: [Soul Scratch] and [Raquel Rodriguez].

As always, [Alex][Alex Nester], [Elmer][Elmer Demond], and the [full-band][URP
Personel 21CG] will be there, playing new selections off our soon to be released
new album [21st Century Ghost][21st Century Ghost Singles], plus a couple new
covers, and lots of new URP apparel to buy.

We will also have a special guest appearance by soul singer [Ronald T. Collins].

For years, Ronald was one of the many anonymous faces living on LA's Skid Row.
He was homeless with no job, no money and at times, no hope. Collins battled
drug addiction, but found some solace in music.

Many of the URP musicians helped him record music back in March that is featured
in a documentary that captures his entire journey called "Mighty Ground." It
premiered in June at the Los Angeles Film Festival.

Joining us on stage Thursday night, Ronald will perform one of his songs from
that documentary.

Doors: 8pm • Music: 9pm
