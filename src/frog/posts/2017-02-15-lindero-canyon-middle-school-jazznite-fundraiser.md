I am very fortunate to be affiliated with Matt McKagan's incredible music
program over at [Lindero Canyon Middle School]. I have been their woodwind
specialist since the winter of 2014/2015 and it's been incredibly rewarding as
both teacher and student (unofficially of Matt's of course!) and I'm very
pleased to be helping them raise money for their program by participating in
this fundraiser concert.
