virtuoso [Elmer Demond], the URP is back with its sophomore release in Local
Legend. The album's 9 original tracks draw from an eclectic variety of
styles—including R&B, swing and West African highlife—while remaining unified by
the melodic earworms and hip-shaking grooves that characterize the group's
sound. [LA Music Blog] called the new record "truly amazing" and [The Seattle
Post-Intelligencer] described it as "the real thing." The tracks are available
on [iTunes], [Amazon], and [Spotify].
