His father, [Richard Clements], was a Juilliard attendee and composer/arranger
in the Los Angeles area. Many stories of run-ins with the famous on the road and
tales of amazing feats of human artistic talent and endeavor in the studios
filled the house from as early as memory can recall. 

It was these stories, and the constant yet subtle old-world presence of his
dad's beautiful Yamaha C3 grand piano in the house that inspired Brian to start
learning piano. It wasn't too long after that Brian started formal Jazz and
Classical study and made the switch to saxophone at age 13. He has been
exploring both the internal and external world through music ever since.

After picking up the flute and clarinet in high school, Brian made his way to
the birthplace of America and one of the most art-nourishing and inspiring
cities in the world: Philadelphia. There he attended a 5 year program at the
[University of the Arts] resulting in his Bachelors of Music in Saxophone
Performance and a Masters of Arts in Teaching degree.

With his degrees and his Pennsylvania and California teaching credentials in
hand, Brian returned to Los Angeles in 2010 to make new and meaningful art and
cultivate his studio with the same warmth and joy of artistic exploration that
was bestowed upon him in his studies.

Over the years, Brian has had the privilege to study musical instruments, muse
about life and art, drink espresso, and spend formative time with Paul Pate,
Vince Trombetta, Lee Secard, Chris Farr, Anthony Salicandro, Dave Sherr, and Ron
Kerber.
